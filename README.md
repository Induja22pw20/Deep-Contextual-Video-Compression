1. Dataset Extraction
Purpose: Unpack the dataset of images (e.g., video frames) from a zip file into a working directory.
Key Operations:
Extract the zip file using zipfile.ZipFile.
Define the extraction path and ensure the files are correctly saved.

2. Load Images
Purpose: Load the images from the extracted folder for processing.
Key Operations:
Iterate through all .png files in the folder.
Resize images to a target resolution (e.g., 32x32 or 256x256) to reduce computational overhead.

3. Build Autoencoder Model
Purpose: Create an autoencoder for compressing the video frames.
Key Components:
Encoder:
Stack convolutional layers and pooling layers to reduce spatial resolution and extract features.
Flatten the features to a bottleneck layer (e.g., a dense layer with 128 or 512 neurons) for compression.
Decoder:
Reverse the encoding process using dense layers, reshaping, and upsampling layers.
Reconstruct the input image with the same shape as the original.
Compilation: Use adam optimizer and mean_squared_error as the loss function.

4. Quantize Images
Purpose: Reduce the precision of image pixel values to achieve higher compression.
Key Operations:
Divide pixel values by a factor (e.g., 32) and round them.
Multiply back to restore scaled values, effectively reducing data precision.

5. Train Autoencoder
Purpose: Train the autoencoder to learn how to compress and reconstruct video frames.
Key Operations:
Normalize images (divide pixel values by 255.0 to scale between 0 and 1).
Use quantized_images as both the input and target for the model.
Train the model for a specified number of epochs (e.g., 5) and batch size.

6. Motion Estimation
Purpose: Estimate the motion vector between two consecutive frames to reduce temporal redundancy.
Key Operations:
Subtract one frame from the next to calculate the motion vector.

7. Motion Compensation
Purpose: Use the motion vector to predict the next frame from the current frame.
Key Operations:
Add the motion vector to the current frame.
Clip pixel values to ensure they remain within the valid range [0, 255].

8. Contextual Encoding
Purpose: Use the trained autoencoder to encode and compress a frame.
Key Operations:
Pass each frame through the encoder to extract compressed features.

9. Reconstruct Video
Purpose: Recreate the compressed video using motion vectors and contextual encoding.
Key Steps:
Iterate through the sequence of frames.
For each pair of consecutive frames:
Estimate the motion vector.
Compensate the motion to predict the next frame.
Encode the compensated frame using the autoencoder.
Store the encoded frames for reconstruction.

10. Save Compressed Video
Purpose: Save the reconstructed video to a file.
Key Operations:
Use cv2.VideoWriter to write each compressed frame to an output video file.
Specify the codec (e.g., 'mp4v'), frame rate, and resolution.

11. Visualize Original vs. Reconstructed Frames
Purpose: Compare the original and reconstructed frames side-by-side to evaluate compression quality.
Key Operations:
Use matplotlib to display both the original and reconstructed frames.
Display frames in rows, where the top row contains original frames and the bottom row contains reconstructed ones.

12. Process the Video
Purpose: Orchestrate all the steps to process the video dataset.
Key Steps:
Load images from the dataset.
Quantize the images for compression.
Train the autoencoder on quantized images.
Reconstruct the video using the trained model, motion estimation, and compensation.
Save the compressed video.
Visualize the results and calculate the compression ratio.
